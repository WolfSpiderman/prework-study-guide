        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains back-end information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user(frond-end).</li>
          <li>The head element should be laid out with meta commands charset, http-equiv, viewport, which should always be set to width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, and title.</li>
          <li>The title used in the head element will be the only visible aspect of the head element and will only be visible in the name of the browser tab.</li>
          <li>UTF-8 seems to be the most commonly used charset, and probably the safest/best to use until I understand more about it and other options</li>
          <li>Currently have little understanding of the http-equiv part of head element, but the commonly used thing here seems to be X-UA-Compatible..</li>

          <li>A "/", followed by a repeat of the element or child element is used to signal the end of an element or child element; all information about that element or child element will be contained within the two.</li>
          <li>A link element creates a connection to an external file, like the css file.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource</li>
            <li>The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS is used for making a webpage look better. There are three ways to style a webpage: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <ol>
            <li>Inline CSS: used for styling an element directly in the HTML file.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a specific page element</li>
              <li>Useful for quick, permanent changes that must be edited individually later, which makes them less flexible than external and internal style sheets.</li>
              <li>Inline CSS is typically used in the body element in HTML</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Internal CSS Style Sheet: Contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head of the HTML file</li>
            <ul>
              <li>The rules only apply to that specific page, and can be used to style multiple elements in the page code, such as adjusting the color of all "h1" elements.</li>
              <li>Configure CSS classes, like color, and IDs, like h1, to identify the elements and style you want to adjust.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>External CSS Style Sheet: A seperate file used for adding CSS rules to a page, which makes design changes easier</li>
            <ul>
              <li>A link to the CSS file will be placed in the head element of the HTML file.</li>
              <li>External style sheets are the most commonly used by developers.</li>
            </ul>
          </ol>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li></li>

        <ul>
          <li>Git commands in Bash will always begin with "git"</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on and whether it is up to date</li>
          <li>git checkout branch-name: switches to that branch</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch with the name provided and switches to it. The -b command is used to create the new branch</li>
          <li>cd directory-name: change directory to the one listed, must move through directories sequentially. Ex: cd bootcamp, then cd prework-study-guide.</li>
          <li>touch: creates new file within current directory</li>
          <li>git pull origin branch-name: pulls information from github repository to local environment to sync/update local repository</li>
          <li>git push origin branch-name: pushes information from local repository to github to sync/update github repository</li>
